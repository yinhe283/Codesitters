Hey!

I heard you are taking a coding class, and I have been trying to learn on my own. Today after spending 10 hours figuring out how to build this one feature, I finally got it to work!

But... then I tried adding a new feature, and it  broke my code!

In the beginning I was really good about backing up my files, but it became too cumbersome after a while. I wish there was a better, less tedious, and faster way of keeping track of all the versions of my code!

Now that you are my most knowledgeable coding friend, can you suggest anything to help me?

Thanks so much!
Dalia
